## Backward Compatible
- JS is backward compatible. This means that old JS code will always be valid in newer versions. This is hard to commit to. Once something is in JS it won't be removed.
- JS isn't forward compatible like HTMl. This means that new additions to the language would not cause an older version, that doesn't know this update, to break. The unknown code will just be ignored.

## Interpreted
- Interpreted script: code will run untill it encounters an error
- compiled program: code won't run initially if there is a bug
