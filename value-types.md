# Values

JS uses multiple values witch all exist out of bits. Chunks of bits are called values:
- Numbers
- Arithmetic
- Special numbers
- Strings
- Unary operators
- Boolean values
- Logical operators
- Empty values
- Automatic type conversion

## Numbers
Number values are numeric values. Simply just numbers like `8`. You are aloud to use numbers with decimals `8.12` and scientific notations with `e` like this: `2.998e8` this means `2.998 x 10^8 = 299.800.000`

##Arthmetic
The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic (using multiple numbers to create new numbers). The artithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`.
